This project is a bunch of scripts aimed to help in daily 
tasks with rst (ReStructuredText) files.

The scripts included in this project are, by now, under construction.
At the moment of writing this, I just plan to dev&use them without
considering issues like robustness, completeness, shareness, etcness

They are not intended to be used directly by anyone without some
knowledge of its internals. Therefore if you plan to use any of them,
remember that it is absolutely by your own risk. 

Nonetheless, I've tried to guard potentially unrecoverable results by
requiring user interaction on execution.

You can do whatever you want with the code of these scripts under the
terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or any later
version (your choice)

Thanks for your interest.
